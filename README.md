All the projects I created while self-learning iOS-Development.

1. üìùGroceryList: It is an application that allows users to create their own grocery list by entering items and the corresponding quantities. The list will display in ascending or descending order, depending on users' choices. 

    Skills Practiced: UILabel, UITextField, UIButton, UITextView, UISwitch, UISegmentedControl, NSLayoutConstraint

2. üîµShapeArena: It is a small game containing three different arenas (viewControllers), Red Square Arena, Blue Circle Arena, and Magic Arena. Take Red Square Arena as an example. In the corresponding viewController, it generates a red square at where the user touches the screen. The user can also change the arena's name by entering a name in the given UITextField and save it. Additionally, in Red Square Arena, the user can control the size of squares through a UISlider and erase unwanted squares. 

    Skills Practiced: UIView, UITextField, UILabel, UISlider, UISegmentedControl, UISwitch, Protocol, touchesBegan, UIAlertController, pushViewController, present viewController

3. üé∂PlayList: It is a simulated music playlist with song names, artist names, album names, and covers. Users can add new songs to the list and edit the ordering. They can also delete current songs by swiping left.
